HELLOSODA - Example UI
======================

To run the example:

python3 demo.py

I only had a couple of hours to do this so things I ran out of time for:

* Registering a hover event on the avatars and then making an api call back to the server
* A back button to get back to the list
* Make it look less like the angular documentation and give it like an original design idea

Enjoy!
